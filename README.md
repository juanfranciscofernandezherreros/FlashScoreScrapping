Flashscore is a popular website that provides live scores, statistics, and news for a variety of sports. However, the website does not provide an API for developers to access this data. This is where FlashscoreScraping comes in.

This project works for users looking for reliable information about sports results. Sports enthusiasts can rely on the scraper's data to track their favorite teams, analyze past results, and predict future outcomes. Additionally, researchers, students, and educators can use the data for academic purposes.


## Getting Started

1. Clone the project

    ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/gustavofariaa/FlashscoreScraping.git

    ```bash
      cd FlashscoreScraping
    ```

1. Install dependencies

    ```bash

    ```

1. Start the crawler

    To use the crawler, you must specify a country and a league. You can also specify whether you want to run the crawler in headless mode and the path to the output file.

    ```bash
      npm run start country=brazil league=serie-a-2023 headless
    ```

    > This command runs the crawler in Brazilian Serie A 2023, in headless mode and saves the results to standard output.

    ```bash
      npm run start country=england league=premier-league-2022-2023 path=./src/data
    ```

    > This command runs the crawler in England Premier League 2022 - 2023, in graphical mode and saves the result to a path `./src/data`.
